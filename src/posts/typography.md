AccessEOS is a simple tool for developers to build their EOSIO smart contract using point-and-click graphical tools. It will initially suport simple table definition with common data types and CRUD actions.

# Capabilities

Initially you'll be able to add tables and for each table, give it a name and add some fields.

# Automatic actions

Each table will get the basic create-read-update-delete actions as well as an upsert action. Then, you can delete whatever you don't need and modify the rest.

The actions will also have basic permissions and I hope this will be a teaching tool as well as a faster starting point for developing smart contracts on EOSIO chains.
